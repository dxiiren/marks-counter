# Marks-Counter

Welcome to the "Marks-Counter" project! This command-line program simplifies the task of calculating total marks for students based on their semester results. It provides a streamlined process for examiners to input the number of semesters, carry marks for each semester, and the actual marks for each student. The program then generates a comprehensive output, summarizing key information about the practical component of a course.

**Usage:**

1. Open the program and follow the on-screen prompts.

2. Input the number of semesters for which marks need to be calculated.

3. For each semester, provide the carry mark percentage and the student's actual mark.

4. The program will display a detailed output summarizing the practical component of the course, including the course code, credit hours, total students, part of the question, and carry mark percentage.

5. It will also list the students' names, marks, and carry marks in a tabular format for easy reference.

**Sample Output:**
